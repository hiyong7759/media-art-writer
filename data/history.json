    "2026-01-25": "Unreal Engine 5 render, Octane Render, 8k. A sprawling mycelial network of glowing emerald and amber tendrils weaving through submerged obsidian columns in a deep underwater atmosphere. Hyper-realistic bioluminescent organic shapes with liquid light flowing through semi-translucent membranes. Volumetric green light beams piercing through murky depths. Subsurface scattering on glowing tendrils, cinematic lighting, dramatic shadows, global illumination."
