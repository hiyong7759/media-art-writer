  "prompt": "A series of suspended liquid droplets frozen in a zero-gravity environment, each acting as a perfect spherical lens refracting a beam of white light into a complex web of spectrum-colored threads. Spectral dispersion and light splitting with high refractive indices. Focus on crystal facets and intense chromatic aberration within the droplets. 8k, hyper-realistic, raytracing. Sharp macro focus on the points where the rainbows intersect. Detailed rainbow caustics projected onto a dark, velvet-textured background. Global illumination captures the pure energy of the rainbow.",
